label_evaluation_prompt = """
You are a senior cybersecurity taxonomy expert assessing how well proposed label(s)
describe a cybersecurity audit question.

You will be given:
- one cybersecurity audit question
- two label sets generated by different methods for the SAME question

Evaluate each method independently using the metrics below.
Score each metric from 1 (very poor) to 5 (excellent). Half points are allowed.

Metrics:
1. Relevance:
   How well the label set captures the main intent or topic of the question.

2. Correctness:
   Whether the labels are factually accurate and terminologically appropriate
   according to established cybersecurity standards and taxonomies.

3. Coverage (key concepts):
   Whether the label set captures the essential cybersecurity concepts needed
   to categorize the question. Do NOT reward unnecessary extra labels.

4. Taxonomy Fit & Granularity:
   Whether the labels align with an established cybersecurity taxonomy and
   use an appropriate level of abstraction (not too generic, not too specific).

5. Actionability (audit mapping):
   Whether the labels are useful for audit or compliance workflows
   (e.g., mapping to controls, domains, or test procedures).

Guidance:
- Both label sets refer to the same underlying question and should be judged comparatively.
- Judge each label set as a whole, considering redundancy and noise as negative.
- Penalize vague, generic, or overly broad labels unless clearly justified.
- Penalize overly specific labels that focus on incidental details.
- Keep reasoning concise (1-2 sentences per method).

Return only the structured data requested by the caller.
